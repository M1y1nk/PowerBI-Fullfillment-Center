I've recently wrapped up an engaging project where I utilized Power BI to transform how we analyze data from our fulfillment centers. Here’s a brief overview of the key aspects we covered:
Customer requirements:

3.What is the Total Discount Value 
4.What is the Total Discount %
5.What is the Top 5 Selling Categories
6.Does operational area of the store influence number of orders
7.Aer Email & product feature on the Home Page an effective mode of promotion?
8. what will be the Next 5 week Forceasted weekly quantity sold for each city, meal and category

🔗 Data Relationships: Established robust relationships between Transactions, Customers, and Products tables, ensuring seamless data integration for holistic insights.
📊 Comprehensive Analysis: Conducted detailed analyses including total sales per product, total sales per customer, and sales trends over time, offering valuable insights into our sales dynamics.
📈 Dynamic Visualizations: Created interactive dashboards and reports to visualize critical metrics such as total revenue, customer purchases, and product performance, empowering data-driven decisions.
🔍 Advanced Filtering: Implemented filters to enable in-depth analysis by specific segments, like sales by payment method or location, enhancing our understanding of various sales channels.
💡 Calculated Fields: Developed calculated fields for advanced metrics like profit margins and customer lifetime value, providing deeper insights into profitability and customer behavior.
This project has significantly improved our ability to analyze and act on fulfillment center data, driving better decision-making and operational efficiency. Excited to see the impact and looking forward to more data-driven projects!
